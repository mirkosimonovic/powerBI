🔎 As a data enthusiast, I embarked on a journey to explore the rich dataset of New York City's restaurant inspections. 
Leveraging the power of Python, I meticulously cleaned and manipulated the data to extract meaningful insights
 and provide a comprehensive analysis of restaurant performance.
📈 My Power BI dashboard highlights key metrics such as the number of restaurants closed due to violations,
 sanctioned restaurants ordered by critical and no-critical flags, and non-sanctioned establishments.
 These metrics are further segmented and beautifully organized by borough, enabling a deep dive into each region's culinary landscape.
📍 The borough-wise ordering of the dashboard allows you to effortlessly navigate through the data,
 uncovering intriguing patterns and trends. Gain valuable insights into the restaurant industry,
 including performance variations across different boroughs, areas of improvement, and best practices for maintaining high standards.
🧹 Data cleaning and manipulation on Python were pivotal in ensuring accurate and reliable results. 
By employing various techniques and algorithms, I ensured the data integrity, enabling decision-makers 
to make informed choices based on robust analysis.
💡 My Power BI dashboard is a valuable resource for restaurant owners, policymakers,
 and industry professionals seeking to understand New York City's dining scene at a glance.
 The interactive nature of the dashboard empowers users to filter and drill down into specific criteria,
 fostering a data-driven approach to restaurant evaluation and decision-making.
